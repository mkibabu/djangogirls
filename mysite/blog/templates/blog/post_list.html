      <h1><a href=''>Samuel Jackson Ipsum</a></h1>
      <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
      mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
      After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know
      exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived
      the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking
      now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.
      Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

      <p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat."
      And "Put on your good vestments." Quite possible. Leela, Bender, we're going
      grave robbing. For the last time, I don't like lilacs!
